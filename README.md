# Hedging Strategy Comparison Dashboard

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook offers an interactive dashboard for evaluating the efficacy and performance of different commodity hedge strategies for a selected commodity. For agricultural commodities, users have the option of gathering data from reliable sources such as The World Bank—Data and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), or they can upload their own historical pricing data. To assist in understanding the trade-offs between different hedging strategies, such as risk reduction and cost, the dashboard computes important performance data and displays interactive visualizations.

## Core Features

* **Interactive Data Input:**
    * Enables users to choose a desired commodity.
    * Enables the uploading of past price information (such as CSV files with spot and futures prices).
    * The ability to access data from web sources such as Quandl, Yahoo Finance, **The World Bank - Data**, and **USDA** is optional.
    * Offers input fields for adjusting parameters of different hedging strategies (e.g., fixed hedge ratio).
* **Implementation of Common Hedging Strategies:**
    * **No Hedging:** Serves as a baseline for comparison.
    * **Fixed Ratio Hedge:** Applies a user-defined constant hedge ratio.
    * **Naive Hedge (1:1):** Hedges the entire spot exposure with an equal amount of futures.
    * **Minimum Variance Hedge:** Dynamically calculates the hedge ratio to minimize portfolio variance based on a rolling window.
    * **Basis Risk Hedge:** Allows exploration of hedging with futures contracts of different maturities.
* **Calculation of Key Performance Metrics:**
    * Portfolio Return
    * Volatility Reduction (compared to no hedging)
    * Value at Risk (VaR)
    * Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
    * Cost of Hedging (estimation based on futures roll)
    * *(Optional: Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown)*
* **Interactive Visualizations (using Plotly or Bokeh):**
    * **Price Series Comparison:** Line plots of spot and futures prices, and hedged/unhedged portfolio values.
    * **Volatility Comparison:** Bar charts or box plots showing volatility across strategies.
    * **Return Distribution:** Histograms or kernel density estimates of returns.
    * **Cumulative Return Chart:** Line plot of cumulative returns for each strategy.
    * **Rolling Volatility Chart:** Time series of rolling volatility.
    * **Risk vs. Return Scatter Plot:** Visualizing the risk-return profile of each strategy.
* **Interactive Controls (using ipywidgets):**
    * Dropdown menus for commodity selection.
    * File upload widget for data input.
    * Sliders or date pickers for selecting the analysis period.
    * Numerical input fields for strategy parameters.
    * Checkboxes or dropdowns to control which metrics and visualizations are displayed.
* **Clear Results Presentation:**
    * Tabular display of calculated performance metrics using Pandas DataFrames.
    * Descriptive text and interpretations of the results and visualizations.
    * *(Optional: Functionality to download results and visualizations)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Required Python Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly ipywidgets
    ```
    *(If you plan to fetch online data):*
    ```bash
    pip install yfinance  # or pip install quandl
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```

2.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Hedging_Strategy_Comparison_Dashboard.ipynb
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Run the Notebook cells sequentially.**
2.  **Data Input:**
    * Select a commodity (if this functionality is implemented).
    * Use the file upload widget to load your historical price data in CSV format. Ensure your CSV file contains columns for spot prices and the relevant futures contract prices, with a consistent date/time index. Consider sourcing reliable data from platforms like **SquareCO** or directly from exchanges and data providers. For agricultural commodities, **USDA** provides extensive historical data. **The World Bank - Data** also offers a broad range of commodity price data.
    * Adjust the date range for analysis using the provided controls.
    * Enter the desired parameters for each hedging strategy (e.g., the fixed hedge ratio).
3.  **Hedging Strategy Selection:** The notebook will automatically calculate the performance for the implemented hedging strategies based on the input data and parameters.
4.  **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore the generated interactive plots to compare the performance of different strategies visually. Use the controls within the plots (zoom, pan, hover) for detailed analysis.
5.  **Performance Metrics:** Review the table displaying the calculated performance metrics for each hedging strategy.
6.  **Interpretation:** Read the accompanying text to understand the implications of the results and the trade-offs between different hedging strategies.
7.  **Customization:** Feel free to modify the code to add more hedging strategies, performance metrics, or customize the visualizations to your specific needs.

## Data Format

The CSV file you upload should ideally have the following columns (names are case-sensitive):

* `Date` or a similar column representing the time index.
* `Spot_Price`: Historical spot prices of the commodity.
* `Futures_Price_Near`: Historical prices of the nearby futures contract used for hedging.
* *(Optional: `Futures_Price_Far`: For basis risk hedging or futures roll cost analysis)*

Ensure that the date column is in a format that Pandas can parse. You might find relevant historical data on platforms like **SquareCO**, **The World Bank - Data**, and the **USDA** websites.

## Assumptions

* The calculations for hedging cost are simplified and may not reflect actual brokerage fees or the complexities of futures contract rolling.
* The Minimum Variance Hedge calculation uses a rolling window of historical data, and the choice of window size can impact the results.
* The accuracy of the analysis depends on the quality and relevance of the input data, which can be sourced from providers like **SquareCO**, **The World Bank - Data**, and the **USDA**.
